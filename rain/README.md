# Rainwater Retention - ALU Interview Project

This project solves the **rainwater trapping problem**, where the goal is to calculate how many square units of water can be trapped between non-negative integer walls after it rains.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Description

Given a list of non-negative integers representing wall heights (1 unit width each), calculate how much water would be trapped between them after rainfall.

For example:
